# Test Results - GoCardless Sync Node.js Function

## ✅ All Tests Passed Successfully

### Test Suite 1: Basic Functionality (`test-seed-data.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Deterministic encryption (same input → same encrypted output)
- ✅ Random encryption (Fernet symmetric encryption)
- ✅ Bank account seeding with encrypted fields
- ✅ Account retrieval with automatic decryption
- ✅ Transaction processing and storage
- ✅ Balance processing and storage
- ✅ Query by userId (plaintext field)
- ✅ Query by accountId (encrypted field, deterministic)
- ✅ Query by category (plaintext field)
- ✅ Query by date range (plaintext field)
- ✅ getLastBookingDate function

**Results**:
- 5 transactions created and encrypted
- 2 balances created and encrypted
- All fields auto-decrypt on read
- All query types working

---

### Test Suite 2: Integration Test (`test-integration.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Complete sync flow simulation
- ✅ Bank account seeding in MongoDB
- ✅ Transaction processing with mock GoCardless data
- ✅ Balance processing with mock GoCardless data
- ✅ Incremental sync (using last booking date)
- ✅ Auto-categorization of transactions
- ✅ Encryption before storage
- ✅ Auto-decryption on retrieval
- ✅ Data validation

**Results**:
- 3 transactions synced successfully
- 2 balances synced successfully
- 3 categories assigned (Income, Restaurants, Shopping)
- All data encrypted and queryable

### Test Suite 3: Client Query Test (`test-client-query.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Query all user transactions (Next.js API pattern)
- ✅ Filter by category (plaintext)
- ✅ Filter by date range (plaintext)
- ✅ Query by encrypted accountId (deterministic)
- ✅ MongoDB aggregation pipeline
- ✅ Financial metrics calculation
- ✅ Auto-decryption of all sensitive fields

**Results**:
- All query patterns working
- Aggregation by category successful
- Metrics calculation accurate
- No decryption errors

## 🔐 Encryption Verification

### Plaintext Fields (Queryable)
- ✅ `userId` - Used for filtering by user
- ✅ `category` - Used for category-based queries
- ✅ `exclude` - Used for filtering excluded transactions
- ✅ `bookingDate` - Used for date range queries and sorting
- ✅ `balanceType` - Used for balance type filtering
- ✅ `referenceDate` - Used for balance date queries

### Encrypted Fields (Deterministic - Equality Queries)
- ✅ `accountId` - Queryable for account-specific data
- ✅ `transactionId` - Queryable for transaction lookups

### Encrypted Fields (Random - Maximum Security)
- ✅ `amount` - Auto-decrypts to readable number
- ✅ `description` - Auto-decrypts to readable text
- ✅ `counterparty` - Auto-decrypts to readable text
- ✅ `currency` - Auto-decrypts to currency code
- ✅ `balanceAmount` - Auto-decrypts to readable number
- ✅ `raw` - Auto-decrypts to full JSON

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Deploy function to Appwrite Cloud Functions
2. Configure all environment variables
3. Set up scheduled execution (e.g., daily sync)
4. Monitor first production run
5. Verify data appears in Next.js app
6. Set up alerts for failed syncs
